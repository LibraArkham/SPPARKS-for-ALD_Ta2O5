app_style potts/am/path/gen command :h3

[Syntax:]

app_style potts/am/path/gen :pre

potts/am/path/gen = application style name :l

:ule

[Examples:]

app_style potts/am/path/gen :pre

This app does not have any app specific parameters.  It does however 
require AM raster commands listed below.

[Description:]

This is a specialized additive manufacturing (AM) application.   The app
generates a sequence of computational volumes (CV) which correspond with AM
raster paths on rectangular domains; it  runs very quickly and does not need to
be run in parallel.  The sequence of CVs generated are ordered according to the
am build specified; the union of CVs forms the final desired 3D rectangular volume over
which microstructures are simulated.  

Microstructure simulations on the sequence of CVs emulates the additive
manufacturing process by appending incremental results to the output database
much the same way material is added to a part during an AM build.  SPPARKS
simulations can be conducted on each CV and stitched together to form the
final built part.  AM microstructure simulations conducted this way require
substantially reduced computational resources, both memory and mpi cpu
resources, when compared to what would be required if the entire domain was
instantiated for one large simulation.  Starting and stopping the sequence of
runs is also a highly flexible restart capability for AM microstructure
simulations.  

To generated CV and raster path information, the "am pathgen"_am_pathgen.html
command, supplied by this app, must be in the user input script; the 
script must also include "am cartesian_layer"_am_cartesian_layer.html and "am
pass"_am_pass.html commands which specify the rectangular domain as well as
raster path information.  The script should not use the "create_sites"_create_sites.html
commad -- more on this below.

The directory examples/stitch/stitching_rectangular_domain contains 
an example demonstrating use of this app. There are 3 primary 
elements to the example: 1) in.path_gen -- input script which 
uses this app; 2) in.am -- input script for a generic AM SPPARKS 
simulation on a CV parameterized; 3) stitch_rectangle.sh -- bash script 
which orchestrates the overall set of simulations.  Very limited 
editing of bash script is required; only the spparks executable path 
is needed at top of script.  Remaining parameters should be specified 
by in.path_gen and in.am.  See directory for further explanation.

The following commands are needed and required by this application.  

"region"_region.html: Specify the larger intended simulation domain for 
the AM microstructure simulation.  This domain will be decomposed by the 
app into a series of significantly small simulation domains (CVs). :l

"create_box"_create_box.html: command to create region specified :l


"am pass"_am_pass.html: Specify pass parameters used to construct
{cartesian_layer}. :l

"am cartesian_layer"_am_cartesian_layer.html: A scan pattern on
rectangular layer constructed from {am pass} and other parameters. :l

"am pathgen"_am_pathgen.html: May be used for combinations of layers that
comprise a pattern. The command must be
specified in the input script to generate output CV and raster information and 
must come after all of the above commands. :l,ule

[Restrictions:] :link(restriction)

Do not use the "create_sites"_create_sites.html command with this application.
For this app to function properly, the "region"_region.html and
"create_box"_create_box.html commands should be used to specify the larger
intended simulation domain.  If {create_sites} is used, the app will attempt to
create a lattice on the larger intended simulation domain potentially requiring
huge distributed memory requirements. If on the other hand the lattice is not created, the
app is extremely light weight and can be used to generate the sequence of CVs
and raster information on the larger intended domain.  Thus the app can easily
run in serial for any domain size provided the {create_sites} command is
not used.  It is not necessary to run the app in parallel although it will 
do so gracefully.  

This application will only generate paths specified by 
the "am cartesian_layer"_am_cartesian_layer.html command and 
associated "am pass"_am_pass.html commands.
