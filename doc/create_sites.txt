[Description:]

This command creates "sites" on a lattice for on-lattice and
off-lattice applications.  For on-lattice applications it also defines
a connectivity between sites that is stored as a neighbor list of
nearby sites that each site interacts with.

This command is an alternative to reading in site coordinates and
neighbor connectivity via the "read_sites"_read_sites.html command.

To use this command, a simulation box must already exist, created via
the "create_box"_create_box.html command.  Likewise a lattice must
also be defined using the "lattice"_lattice.html command.

In SPPARKS, a "site" is a point in space at which an application, as
defined by the "app_style"_app_style.html command, can perform events.
For on-lattice applications, the site is static and has a static set
of neighboring sites with which it interacts.  For off-lattice
applications, a site is like a particle.  It moves and has a dynamic
neighborhood of nearby particles with which it interacts.

This command generates the set of lattice points that fall within the
simulation box.  For any periodic dimension as specified by the
"boundary"_boundary.html command, the origin of the lattice is the
lower box boundary (in that dimension).  Thus coordinates begin at the
lower boundary and increment by the lattice constant (in that
dimension).  The simulation box size must be an integer multiple of
the lattice constant, to insure consistent placement of sites near
periodic boundaries.  SPPARKS is careful to put exactly one site on a
periodic boundary (on the lower side of the box), not zero or two.

For non-periodic dimensions, the origin of the lattice is 0.0 (in that
dimension).  Thus coordinates begin at 0.0 and increment in both
directions.  Only coordinate inside the simulation box become sites.
If a lattice point is inside or on a lower boundary (in that
dimension), it is a site.  Likewise if a lattice point is outside or
on an upper boundary (in that dimension) it is considered outside the
box.  Thus for non-periodic dimensions you may need to tweak the
simulation box size to get precisely the sites you want.

For the {box} style, all lattice points that fall inside the
simulation box are stored as sites, as described in the preceding
paragraphs.  For the {region} style, a lattice point must additionally
be consistent with the region volume to be stored as a site.  Note
that a region can be specified so that its volume is inside or outside
a box boundary.

For on-lattice applications, after sites have been created, a neighbor
list is also generated for each site, as defined by each "lattice
style"_lattice.html.  Think of this as the set of lattice points near
a central site, with which it interacts in the sense defined by an
application.  If the simulation box is periodic in a dimension, the
neighbors of a central site may include sites on the other side of the
box.  This will not be the case for a non-periodic dimension.  If some
sites do not exist, e.g. when using the {region} style, then those
sites will not have a complete set of neighbors.

SPPARKS attempts to create sites with consecutive IDs from 1 to N,
where N is the total number of sites that fill the simulation box.
But it cannot always do this.  In these scenarios consecutive IDs
should be produced:

{style} = box and the simulation box is fully periodic :ulb,l

style = box, the simulation box is fully periodic or non-periodic (in
one or more dimensions), a simple regular lattice is used, namely line
(line/2n) for 1d models, square (sq/4n or sq/8n) for 2d, or simple
cubic (sc/6n or sc/26n) for 3d, and the {global} keyword is not used
:l,ule

In the 2nd scenario the site IDs will vary fastest in x, then in y,
and slowest in z.  So it easy to use another program to generate
values on a regular lattice associated with the correct IDs.

In all other cases, the site IDs may not be consecutive (1 to N).
In particular, they may not be consecutive in any of these cases:

{style} = region :ulb,l

the {global} keyword is used :l

the simulation box is non-periodic (in one or more dimensions) and the
lattice is not one of the simple regular lattices listed above for 1d,
2d, or 3d :l,ule

Regardless of what the site IDs are, they will be the same independent
of the number of processors used to run the simulation.

Depending on the "application"_app_style.html, each site stores zero
of more integer and floating-point values.  By default these are set
to zero when a site is created by this command.  The {value} and
{basis} keywords can override the default.

The {value} keyword specifies a per-site value that will be assigned
to every site as it is created.  The {label} determines which per-site
quantity is set.  {iN} and {dN} mean the Nth integer or floating-point
quantity, with 1 <= N <= Nmax.  Nmax is defined by the application.
If {label} is specified as {site} it is the same as {i1}.  The
quantity is set to the specified {nvalue}, which should be either an
integer or floating-point numeric value, depending on what kind of
per-site quantity is being set.

The {basis} keyword can be used to override the {value} keyword
setting for individual basis sites as each unit cell is created.  The
per-site quantity (e.g. i2) specified by the {value} keyword is set
for basis sites {M}.  The quantity is set to the specified {nvalue}
for the {basis} keyword, instead of the {nvalue} from the {value}
keyword.  See the "lattice"_lattice.html command for specifics on how
basis atoms and unit cells are defined for each lattice style.

M can be specified in one of two ways.  An explicit numeric value can
be used, such as 2.  A wild-card asterisk can also be used in place of
or in conjunction with the M argument to specify multiple basis sites
together.  This takes the form "*" or "*n" or "n*" or "m*n".  If N =
the total number of basis sites, then an asterisk with no numeric
values means all sites from 1 to N.  A leading asterisk means all
sites from 1 to n (inclusive).  A trailing asterisk means all sites
from n to N (inclusive).  A middle asterisk means all sites from m to
n (inclusive).

The {global} keyword only affects generation of site IDs.  It can only
be used for on-lattice applications, for {style} = box, and for simple
regular lattices.  The latter requirement means lattice = line
(line/2n) for 1d models, square (sq/4n or sq/8n) for 2d, or simple
cubic (sc/6n or sc/26n) for 3d.

It is useful when a series of SPPARKS simulations are being run on a
global lattice of sites that is larger than the simulation box for an
individual simulation, e.g. in an additive manufacturing model.  In
this scenario, the per-site values used to initialize a simulation are
typically read from a file (see the "read_sites"_read_sites.html or
"set file"_set.html commands) and the per-site values generated by the
simulation are archived to a file (see the "dump hdf5"_dump.html
command).  In both cases the archive file contains sites for the
entire global lattice and is accessed by site IDs.  This command
allows an individual SPPARKS simulation to generate site IDs that
match those in the file for the global lattice.

The {Xfull}, {Yfull}, {Zfull} values are the size of the global
lattice.  Its site IDs are assumed to run from 1 to N =
Xfull*Yfull*Zfull.  Note that for a 2d model, Zfull = 1 is required.
As described above for SPPARKS site IDs on a regular lattice, the
global IDs vary fastest in x, then y, and slowest in z.

To use the {global} option correctly, the simulation box created by
the "create_box"_create_box.html command must be specified
appropriately.

If a dimension of the global lattice is intended to be non-periodic,
because a single SPPARKS simulation will only model a portion of that
dimension, then SPPARKS must set it to be non-periodic via the
"boundary"_boundary.html command.  And the lo/hi box boundaries in
that dimension, as specified by the "create_box"_create_box.html
command, should be set so that lattice sites are generated that
correspond to the desired portion of the global lattice.  

For example, imagine a global lattice that is 1000x2000 for a 2d
simulation with both dimensions non-periodic.  And you wish SPPARKS to
model the lower left 100x100 corner of that global lattice.
Assume the x and y lattice spacings are 1.0.

The following commands would setup the sites for this simulation:

dimension	 2
boundary         p p p
lattice		 sq/4n 1.0
region		 box block 1 100.1 1 100.1 -0.5 0.5
create_box	 box
create_sites	 box global 1000 2000 1 :pre

Picture the global lattice as a 1000x2000 array of sites numbered with
IDs ranging from 1 to 2 million, where the lower left corner has ID =
1, and the IDs increase fastest in x, and slowest in y.  SPPARKS will
create sites with coordinates and IDs corresponding to the lower left
100x100 corner of that array.  I.e. the sites in the 100x100 SPPARKS
model will be ordered as follows:

1,2,3, ..., 100                 # first row of x sites
1001,1002,1003, ... 1100        # next row of x sites
...
99001,99002,99003, ... 99100    # last row of x sites :pre

Note the need to use {xhi} = {yhi} = 100.1, instead of 100.0, in the
"create_box" command for the upper bound of non-periodic dimensions.
This is because, as explained above, a non-periodic box will not
generate sites that lie exactly on the upper-boundary (in any
dimension).  So if 100.0 were used, the size of the SPPARKS domain in
that dimension would be one less than desired.

Similarly, the same commands with this substitution:

region		 box block 901 1000.1 901 1000.1 -0.5 0.5 :pre

would model the upper right corner of the global lattice.  The site at
the lower left corner of the 100x100 SPPARKS simulation would have ID
= 1900901; the upper-right corner site would have ID = 2 million.

Finally, if a dimension of the global lattice is intended to be
periodic, then SPPARKS must set it to be periodic via the
"boundary"_boundary.html command and each SPPARKS simulation must span
that entire dimension.  As described above, the simulation box size in
that dimension must thus be N lattice units in size, where N = Nfull
for that dimension.  For example, if y is a periodic dimension, then
the ylo and yhi parameters in the "create_box"_create_box.html command
must be such that yhi-ylo = Yfull.  Any pair of ylo,yhi values that
satisfy this constraint can be used.

Here are more examples of several sets of SPPARKS create_sites
commands using the {global} keyword, for 2d global lattices of 2
different sizes, with either periodic or non-periodic boundaries.

[Restrictions:]

The "app_style"_app_style.html command must be used to define an
application before using the create_sites command.  The
"create_box"_create_box.html command must be used to to define the
simulation box before using the create_sites_command.

As explained above, the {global} keyword only affects generation of
site IDs.  It can only be used for on-lattice applications, for
{style} = box, and for simple regular lattices.  The latter
requirement means lattice = line (line/2n) for 1d models, square
(sq/4n or sq/8n) for 2d, or simple cubic (sc/6n or sc/26n) for 3d.
