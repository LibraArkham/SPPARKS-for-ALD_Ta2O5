diffusion/multiphase command :h3

[Syntax:]

diffusion/multiphase keyword args :pre

keyword = {phase} or {pin} or {weight} :ulb,l
  {phase} arg = ID
    ID = phase label (integer)
  {pin} arg = ID
    ID = phase label (integer) for a pinned phase
  {weight} args = w pair i j
    w = weight applied between phases i and j
    pair = required keyword
    i,j = pair of phase labels :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

diffusion/multiphase pin 1
diffusion/multiphase phase 2
diffusion/multiphase phase 3
diffusion/multiphase weight 0.5 pair 2 3 :pre

[Description:]

This command is used with the "app_style
diffusion/multiphase"_app_diffusion_multiphase.html application.

The command is typically used multiple times, each time with one of 3
keywords.

The command must be used once for each defined phase, either with the
{phase} keyword or the {pin} keyword.

The {phase} keyword defines a mobile phase (which can diffuse) with an
integer phase label.

The {pin} keyword defines an immobile phase with an integer phase
label.  Pinned sites never exchange values with another site, i.e. the
sites in a pinned phase do not diffuse.  

There is no limit to the number of phases which can be defined.
However there should always be two or more non-pinned phases in your
model.  Otherwise no diffusive exchanges between sites with different
phases will take place.

The {weight} keyword specifies a pairwise bond energy (weight) between
two neighboring sites with the specified I,J phase values.  The
default weight for all pairs of unlike phases is 1.0.  A weight
specified for an I,J pair will also be applied to J,I.  Note that a
weight cannot be assigned to an I,I pair; a pair of I,I neighbors do
not contribute to the energy of either site.

In the 4 example lines above, 3 phases are defined.  Phase 1 is
pinned, phases 2 and 3 are not.  A weight of 0.5 is applied to the 2,3
pair of phases.  The weights for the 1,2 and 1,3 pairing are the
default values of 1.0.

[Restrictions:]

This command can only be used with the "app_style
diffusion/multiphase"_app_diffusion_multiphase.html application.

[Related commands:]

[Default:] 

When pairwise weights are not defined, weights values default to 1.0.
