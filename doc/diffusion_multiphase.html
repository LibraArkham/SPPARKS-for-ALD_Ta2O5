<H3>diffusion/multiphase command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>diffusion/multiphase keyword args 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>keyword = <I>phase</I> or <I>pin</I> or <I>weight</I> 

<PRE>  <I>phase</I> arg = ID
    ID = phase label (integer)
  <I>pin</I> arg = ID
    ID = phase label (integer) for a pinned phase
  <I>weight</I> args = w pair i j
    w = weight applied between phases i and j
    pair = required keyword
    i,j = pair of phase labels

<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This command is used with the <A HREF = "app_diffusion_multiphase.html">app_style
diffusion/multiphase</A> application.
</P>
<P>The command is typically used multiple times, each time with one of 3
keywords.
</P>
<P>The command must be used once for each defined phase, either with the
<I>phase</I> keyword or the <I>pin</I> keyword.
</P>
<P>The <I>phase</I> keyword defines a mobile phase (which can diffuse) with an
integer phase label.
</P>
<P>The <I>pin</I> keyword defines an immobile phase with an integer phase
label.  Pinned sites never exchange values with another site, i.e. the
sites in a pinned phase do not diffuse.  
</P>
<P>There is no limit to the number of phases which can be defined.
However there should always be two or more non-pinned phases in your
model.  Otherwise no diffusive exchanges between sites with different
phases will take place.
</P>
<P>The <I>weight</I> keyword specifies a pairwise bond energy (weight) between
two neighboring sites with the specified I,J phase values.  The
default weight for all pairs of unlike phases is 1.0.  A weight
specified for an I,J pair will also be applied to J,I.  Note that a
weight cannot be assigned to an I,I pair; a pair of I,I neighbors do
not contribute to the energy of either site.
</P>
<P>In the 4 example lines above, 3 phases are defined.  Phase 1 is
pinned, phases 2 and 3 are not.  A weight of 0.5 is applied to the 2,3
pair of phases.  The weights for the 1,2 and 1,3 pairing are the
default values of 1.0.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This command can only be used with the <A HREF = "app_diffusion_multiphase.html">app_style
diffusion/multiphase</A> application.

</P>
<P><B>Default:</B> 
</P>
<P>When pairwise weights are not defined, weights values default to 1.0.
