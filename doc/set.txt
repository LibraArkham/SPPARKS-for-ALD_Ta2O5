[Description:]

Reset a per-site value for one or more sites.  Each on-lattice or
off-lattice application defines what per-site values are stored with
each site in its model.  When sites are created by the
"create_sites"_create_sites.html or "read_sites"_read_sites.html
commands, their per-site values may be set to zero or to values
specified by those commands.  This command enables the values to be
changed, either before the first "run"_run.html, or between runs.

The {label} determines which per-site quantity is set.  {iN} and {dN}
mean the Nth integer or floating-point quantity, with 1 <= N <= Nmax.
Nmax is defined by the application.  If {label} is specified as {site}
it is the same as {i1}.  For off-lattice applications, the {x} or {y}
or {z} or {xyz} coordinates of each site can be adjusted.

For label {iN} or {dN} or {site}, the styles {value} or {range} can be used.

For style {value}, the per-site quantity is set to the specified
{nvalue}, which should be either an integer or floating-point numeric
value, depending on what kind of per-site quantity is being set.

For style {range}, the per-site quantity is set to a random value
between {lo} and {hi} (inclusive).  Both {lo} and {hi} should be
either integer or floating-point numeric values, depending on what kind
of per-site quantity is being set.

For style {unique}, the per-site quantity is set to the site ID, which
is effectively a value unique to each site.  This can be useful, for
example, for setting the initial spin of each site to a unique value.

NOTE: The {displace} style is not yet implemented but will be soon.
The following text explains how it will work for off-lattice
applications.

For style {displace}, the {label} must be {x} or {y} or {z} or {xyz}
For labels {x} or {y} or {z}, the corresponding coordinate of each
site is displaced by a random distance between -{delta} and {delta}.
For lables {xyz} the site is displaced to a new random point within a
sphere of radius {delta} surrounding the site (or a circle for 2d
models, or a line segement for 1d models).

Styles {stitch} and {bfile} can only be used for simple regular
lattices.  This means lattice = line (line/2n) for 1d models, square
(sq/4n or sq/8n) for 2d, or simple cubic (sc/6n or sc/26n) for 3d.
See the "create_sites"_create_sites.html command for more details.
The {fraction}, {loop}, {region} and {if} keywords are ignored for
these styles; these styles set values for all sites in the system.

For style {stitch}, a {stitch} file is read to extract values
associated with a specified {label}.  The {stitch} file can be created
by the "dump stitch"_dump.html command or an external program.  A
{stitch} file can store multiple values for the same site, each with a
different timestamp.  A different number of values can also be
associated with each site.  The specified {tstamp} value is used to
determine which of the multiple values is used for initializing each
site.  The specified time value {tstamp} should exist in the file for
at least some sites; it can exist on all the sites or just some of
them.  For sites that do not have a value for the {tstamp} time but
have a value at an earlier time, those sites will be set with the
value matching the most recent time stamp stored in the file.  It is
an error if the file does not contain any values for the specified
{tstamp}.  A subsequent set command can be used to initialize the
value of any sites in a different way.

See the examples/stitch dir for examples of SPPARKS scripts
that read and write {stitch} files.

For style {bfile}, a binary file is read to extract the values
associated with the specified {label}.  The binary file must be
created by an external program.  It should contain 3 integer header
values: Nx, Ny, Nz.  These must match the size of the regular lattice
defined for the enitre simulation box.  For 2d simulations, Nz = 1.

The file must then contain N integer or double values, depending on
whether the {label} is for integer or floating point site values.  N
must be Nx * Ny * Nz.  The site values in the file must be ordered
with x varying fastest, then y, and z slowest.  The binary file is
read by a single processor, and the values are broadcast to all
processors.  Each processor then extracts the subset of values from
the 3d array of sites that correspond to the sites in its sub-domain
of the simulation box.

The optional keywords enables selection of sites whose {label}
quantity will be reset to a new value.  Note that these optional
keywords can be used in various combinations, and the {if} keyword can
be used multiple times, to select desired sites.

The keyword {fraction} means that only a fraction of the sites will
be reset, where 0 < {frac} <= 1.0.  For each site a random number R is
generated and the reset only occurs if R < {frac}.

The keyword {region} means that only sites in the specified region
will be reset.  Note that a defined region can be a union or
intersection of several regions and can be either inside or outside a
geometric boundary; see the "region"_region.html command for details.

The keyword {loop} determines how sites in the simulation box are
looped over when their per-site quantity is reset.  In general, each
processor will own some subset Nlocal of the total number of sites
Nglobal in the simulation box.  The entire set of sites are assumed to
have IDs from 1 to Nglobal.  For {loop all}, each processor performs a
loop from 1 to Nglobal and generates the new value for that site.  If
it owns the site, then it resets its value.  This means that the
changes to per-site values will be the same, independent of which
processor owns which site.  For {loop local}, each processor loops
over only its sites from 1 to Nlocal.  This may be faster, but if
random numbers are used to determine new per-site values, it will give
different answers depending on the the number of processors used.

The keyword {if} sets a condition that must be met in order for the
per-site quantity to be reset.  The per-site quantity specified by
{label2} is compared to the numeric {nvalue2} and if the condition is
not met, then the site is skipped.

[Restrictions:]

The {stitch} style is part the STITCH package.  It is only enabled if
SPPARKS was built with that package.  See "Section
2.3"_Section_start.html#start_3 for more info on how to do this.

[Related commands:]

"create_sites"_create_sites.html, "read_sites"_read_sites.html

[Default:]

The default values for the optional keywords is fraction 1.0 and loop
all.  No region is defined by default nor are any if-tests.
