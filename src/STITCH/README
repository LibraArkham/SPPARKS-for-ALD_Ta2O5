The {stitch} library, available at http://...  manages structure and access to
a {stitch} file.  NOTE: {stitch} has not yet been formally released but will be
very soon as of January 2019.  At that time, {stitch} can be built and used
with SPPARKS as described here.  

The STITCH package allows SPPARKS to use the "Stitch library"_stitch for I/O;
it adds {dump stitch} and {set stitch} commands which enable SPPARKS to 
conduct large-scale parallel read(s)/write(s) of lattice values 
to and from a single {stitch} file.

{Stitch} was developed by:

* Jay Lofstead, gflofst@sandia.gov, Sandia National Laboratories
* John Mitchell, jamitch@sandia.gov, Sandia National Laboratories

The library can be downloaded and built in lib/stitch or elsewhere on
your system, which must be done before bulding SPPARKS.
Details of the download, build, and install process for the
{stitch} library are given in the lib/stitch/README file, and an
Install.py is provided to help automate the process.  Also see
Section_start.html of the SPPARKS manual for general information on
building SPPARKS with packages and the Stitch library.

Once SPPARKS is successfully built with the {stitch} library, it can be
verified using SPPARKS input script examples from the examples/stitch
directory.  See  README file for further instructions.
