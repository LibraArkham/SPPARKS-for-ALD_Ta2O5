Examples in this directory demonstrate use of diffusion/multiphase
app.  Each example has an input script and requires an initial
microstructure; the initial microstructure is provided by a separately
created stitch file which is also included in this directory.

* in.pairwise_weights; requires "vf03_nvox100.st"
* in.pin_filler; requires "vf03_nvox100.st"
* in.variable_volume_fraction; requires "vf03_nvox100.st"
* in.two_filler_unequal_affinities; requires two_filler_types_100x100x100.st
* in.three_filler_unequal_affinities; requires three_filler_types_100x100x100.st

The examples can be run in serial or parallel; log files for parallel
runs (on 8 processors) are included in this directory.  Log files
demonstrate what a normal SPPARKS run should nominally look like on 8
processors for the above scripts.  On 8 processors, the examples run
in less than 5 minutes.

* log.multiphase.pin_filler.22June21.linux.8

* log.multiphase.two_filler_unequal_affinities.6Jun22.linux.8
* log.multiphase.three_filler_unequal_affinities.6June22.linux.8

The examples demonstrate use of the app-specific diffusion/multiphase
command; the input scripts are documentated for ease of use and
understanding.

Each example dumps a stitch file and 4 images (jpeg) representing the
evolution of two different dynamic phases and in some cases
constrained by one or more pinned phases.
