This sintering examples reads a gzipped data file via
the read_sites command.  To do this SPPARKS must have been
built with the -DSPPARKS_GZIP option in the Makefile.

If you did not or cannot do that, you can uncompress the file:

gunzip CuO3.spins.gz

and also swap the commented/uncommented lines for
the read_sites command in the input script,
and then run the script using the uncompressed file.
