This directory contains 3 subdirectories -- primarily associated with
exercising the 'am path' command.  The examples in this directory may
take 30 minutes to an hour running on 4 to 8 processors.  It's best to
run these examples on 4 or 8 processors otherwise they may take nearly
an hour or more to run.

There is a python script which may be used to visualize results for
all of the tests provided the bounding box information is properly
edited.

* path_raster_cartesian_LL; one example demonstrating use of
  'potts/am/weld' app along with 'am pass' and 'am cartesian layer'
  commands.  This example creates a stitch file
  'path_raster_cartesian_LL.st' which may be visualized using using
  the python script 'process_stitch.py' script.

  % python process_stitch -ppath_raster_cartesian_LL

* path_raster_a; this example demonstrates use of 'am path' command as
  well as progressive IO using 'stitch'; there are two spparks scripts
  in the directory which are intended to be run one after the
  other. Subsequently, the python script can be used to visualize the
  collective results from both simulations.

  % python process_stitch -ppath_raster_cartesian_LL

* pattern_repeat; this example demonstrates use of 'am build' command
  for creating repeating raster patterns comprised of multiple layers.
  This example contains its own 'process_stitch.py' script which may
  be used to visualize resulting simulation.  Edit this script as
  necessary to visualize different layers in the build.
