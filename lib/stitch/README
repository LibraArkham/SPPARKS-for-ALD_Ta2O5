The Stitch library was developed by John Mitchell (jamitch@sandia.gov)
and Jay Lofstead (gflofst@sandia.gov) at Sandia National Laboratories.
It was conceived of and intended for use with SPPARKS additive
manufacturing microstructure simulations.  However, it may have other
applications.

The libstitch sub-directory contains the Stitch source code.  A 'v1.1' tag was
created in the 'stitch.repo' corresponding to the stitch source released with
SPPARKS.  Any development after this tag 'v1.1' in 'stitch.repo' is untested.
Only stitch source code included here in 'lib/stitch/libstitch/' is known to
work with SPPARKS.  The exact list of files taken from 'stitch.repo' are listed
in the file 'rsync_stitch_src.sh' contained within this directory.

Three similar but different methods for building the stitch library and python
module are described below. The first two methods are the simplest way to build
SPPARKS with the Stitch library.  If they do not work for some reason, see
method (3) or more detailed instructions below.

Also see the instructions below on how to build the 'stitch' python module,
which will be useful for accessing stitch database files directly via python.

(1) From the src directory using make

% cd spparks/src
% make lib-stitch args="-b"   # build the Stitch library and set links to it
% make yes-stitch             # install the STITCH package
% make mpi                    # or whichever machine target you wish

(2) From the lib directory using Install.py

% cd spparks/lib/stitch
% python Install.py -b        # build the Stitch library and set links to it
% cd spparks/src
% make yes-stitch             # install the STITCH package
% make mpi                    # or whichever machine target you wish

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

(3) Manual build of the Stitch library from this directory or
using a version you have downloaded to your system:

% cd $STITCHDIR                # STITCHDIR = the Stitch library directory
% make                         # build Stitch with default Makefile
% make -f Makefile.custom      # build Stitch with custom Makefile
% cd spparks/lib/stitch
% ln -s $STITCHDIR liblink     # set two links in SPPARKS lib/stitch
% ln -s $STITCHDIR includelink
% cd spparks/src
% make yes-stitch              # install the STITCH package
% make mpi                     # or whichever machine target you wish

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

More build details:

Let 'SPPARKS' denote the path to the SPPARKS root directory.  

The folders and files in the 'SPPARKS' root directory should include the
following:

ls $SPPARKS
doc/  examples/  lib/  LICENSE  python/  README src/  tools/  www/

The 'lib/' directory contains 'stitch' source code in 'lib/stitch/libstitch',
and instructions for building the 'stitch' libraries.  Two 'stitch' libraries
generally need to be built.

1) library for use with SPPARKS; must be built with mpicc
2) python module; must have python 3, numpy, scipy 

About the 'stitch' source code 
 * 'stitch' source code is released with SPPARKS
 * 'stitch' development is conducted in a different git repository 
   referred to here as 'stitch.repo'


Build libstitch.a for use with SPPARKS
--------------------------------------

To use 'stitch' related commands in SPPARKS input scripts, 
the stitch library 'libstitch.a' must be built prior to building SPPARKS.

In general, it is desirable to run SPPARKS in parallel; so 'libstitch.a' must 
be built with a suitable mpi compiler.

Build library in '$SPPARKS/lib/stitch/libstitch/'
% cd $SPPARKS/lib/stitch/libstitch/

Make sure that mpicc and mpicxx are on your path
Copy the example Makefile.flamer; edit and set CC and CXX 
appropriately for your mpi compiler
% cp Makefile.flamer Makefile.my_makefile

Build 'libstitch.a'
% make -f Makefile.my_makefile stitch.lib

Confirm there were not compile or link errors; Confirm the existence of
'libstitch.a'

Congratulations you have built 'libstitch.a'

To make use of the library 'libstitch.a', the following links 
must be created; these point SPPARKS to the 'stitch' header file 
'stitch.h' and also the library 'libstitch.a' built above.  

% cd $SPPARKS/lib/stitch
% ln -s $SPPARKS/lib/stitch/libstitch liblink
% ln -s $SPPARKS/lib/stitch/libstitch includelink

Build SPPARKS with Stitch
-------------------------

SPPARKS must be built with the same mpi compiler used for 
building 'stitch'; Edit the makefile appropriately to 
set path to mpicxx.

% cd $SPPARKS/src
% make yes-stitch
% make mpi (or whatever target you wish)

See some example scripts which use stitch related commands.
There is a README file

% cd $SPPARKS/examples/stitch/README

Examples
% cd $SPPARKS/examples/stitch/dump_and_set_cmds

Run 'stitch_test'
% cd $SPPARKS/lib/stitch/libstitch
% make stitch_test
% mpiexec -np 4 stitch_test

Should see something like:

 nprocs in x, y, z: 2, 2, 1
 block size in x, y, z: 2, 2, 3
 increment in x, y, z: 3, 3, 1
 total domain bounds (min) - (max): (0, 0, 0) - (13, 13, 4)
 sweeping 0->n in X, then Y, then Z
 tests passed

Build the 'stitch' python module
--------------------------------

The 'stitch' python module allows for creating, reading and 
writing 'stitch' files.  It is particularly useful 
for reading 'stitch' files written by 'spparks'.

The python module should be build with gnu gcc.  It may be possible to 
do otherwise but that has not been tested.  In general, the same compiler
used to build python, numpy, and scipy should be used to build the stitch 
module.

Python 3, numpy, and scipy are required for building the 'stitch' python
module.  This documentation was developed with the following versions.

* gnu gcc 9.2.0
* Python 3.6.9
* numpy '1.19.2'
* scipy '1.5.2'

Change to stitch directory 
% cd $SPPARKS/lib/stitch

The files 'setup.py' and 'setup.flamer.cfg' are included in this directory.

Building the python module uses the methods and tools deployed by numpy and
scipy.  It uses the 'setup.py' script and the config file setup.cfg.  Copy
the existing example config file 'setup.flamer.cfg' to 'setup.cfg'; edit
'setup.cfg' to specify where the python module should be installed -- then 
add this path to your PYTHONPATH.

Build and install the python module.
% python setup.py build
% python setup.py install

Some build 'warnings' may occur which are generally harmless.  On the other
hand 'errors' are not good and must be addressed.  

Verify install and PYTHONPATH are correctly set by launching python and
importing the stitch module. Make sure not to do this in the source directory.

If the following command succeeds, python module build and install is
probably good.  Start an interactive python session by launching python 
and import the stitch module:
% python
% from stitch.libstitch import libstitch

As final verification of python module correctness, run the unit test; remove
all stitch files prior to running the test -- otherwise the test will fail.
% cd $SPPARKS/lib/stitch/verify
% make clean

Run unit test
% python unit_cv_readwrite.py

Screen output from test should look something like:

.........
