This directory contains libraries that can be linked to when building
SPPARKS, if particular packages are included in the SPPARKS build.

Most of these directories contain code for building and/or linking 
exernal libraries with SPPARKS; some contain a
Makefile.spparks file that describes specialized building and/or 
linking commands required for using the library with SPPARKS.

In either case, the library itself must be installed and/or built
first, so that the appropriate library files exist for SPPARKS to link
against.

Each library directory contains a README with additional info about
how to acquire and/or build the library.  This may require you to edit
one of the provided Makefiles to make it suitable for your machine.

The libraries in this directory are the following:

stitch          STITCH package for efficient I/O of grain growth 
                simulations in SPPARKS; STITCH package is developed 
		by Sandia Laboratories: John Mitchell and Jay Lofstead.
